# FALL-2019---Embedded-Microcontroller-Systems-Project-at-UTA
Designed a low cost(less than $10)  system capable of generating various waveforms on two analog inputs while also providing two analog outputs to allow measurement of the amplitude of a signal, providing feedback for automatic level control and load impedance estimation using an ARM M4F CORE(TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller).
